Problem 3: REST API for Student Management (CRUD with Express)
Task:

Create REST APIs without a database (use an in-memory array).

Student Object:

  "id": Number,
  "name": String,
  "marks": Number
}
APIs:
POST /students → Add student
GET /students → Get all students
PUT /students/:id → Update student
DELETE /students/:id → Delete student
Constraints:
Validate input (name required, marks ≥ 0)
Return proper HTTP status codes
